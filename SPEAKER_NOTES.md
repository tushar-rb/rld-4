# Revenue Leakage Detection System
## Speaker Notes

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Script:**
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'm excited to present our Revenue Leakage Detection System - an intelligent platform that combines AI agents and vector databases to automatically detect and resolve revenue leakage in organizations."

---

## Slide 2: Problem Statement
**Script:**
"Let's start by understanding the problem we're solving. Revenue leakage is a significant issue for many organizations, where they lose money due to various billing and provisioning errors. This includes missing charges for services that were actually provided, incorrect billing rates that don't match contract terms, mismatches between billed usage and actual usage, and duplicate billing entries. Traditionally, detecting these issues has been a manual, time-consuming process that's prone to human error, and existing systems often lack the intelligence to perform root cause analysis and automated resolution."

---

## Slide 3: Solution Overview
**Script:**
"Our solution is a comprehensive Revenue Leakage Detection System that addresses these challenges through intelligent automation. The system provides real-time anomaly detection, AI-powered root cause analysis, automated incident investigation, financial impact visualization, and seamless integration capabilities with existing systems. What makes our solution unique is the combination of rule-based detection with machine learning, powered by CrewAI agents and Qdrant vector database for knowledge storage."

---

## Slide 4: System Architecture
**Script:**
"The system follows a modern data processing architecture. We start with data ingestion from various sources like billing systems, service provisioning records, usage logs, and contracts. This data flows through stream processing for real-time enrichment, then enters our detection engine which combines rule-based checks with machine learning models. When anomalies are detected, our CrewAI agents take over for investigation, storing knowledge in Qdrant vector database, and finally creating tickets in your ticketing system while providing comprehensive dashboards for monitoring."

---

## Slide 5: Technology Stack
**Script:**
"From a technical perspective, we've built this using modern, robust technologies. The backend is in Python, leveraging CrewAI for multi-agent orchestration - this allows us to have specialized AI agents working together on investigations. We use Qdrant as our vector database for intelligent storage and retrieval of incident knowledge. Google's Gemini LLM powers our AI reasoning capabilities. For the API layer, we use FastAPI. The frontend is built with Streamlit for an interactive dashboard experience, with Plotly for rich visualizations. For deployment, we support Docker containerization and Streamlit Cloud hosting."

---

## Slide 6: Core Detection Engine
**Script:**
"Our detection engine is the heart of the system, combining rule-based logic with machine learning approaches. We have four core detection rules: missing charges detection identifies when services are provisioned but not billed, incorrect rate detection catches billing rates that don't match contract terms, usage mismatch detection finds discrepancies between billed and actual usage, and duplicate entry detection spots redundant billing records. The engine processes data in real-time, offers configurable sensitivity settings, calculates financial impact automatically, and collects evidence for each incident."

---

## Slide 7: AI Investigation with CrewAI
**Script:**
"What really sets our solution apart is the AI investigation powered by CrewAI. We have a team of specialized AI agents working together: the Triage Agent classifies and prioritizes incidents based on severity and financial impact, the Evidence Collector gathers all relevant data from various sources, the RCA Agent performs deep root cause analysis using both data analysis and knowledge base lookup, and the Ticket Creator generates and routes investigation tickets to appropriate teams. This autonomous approach significantly reduces manual effort while ensuring consistent, thorough investigation processes."

---

## Slide 8: Qdrant Vector Database
**Script:**
"For knowledge storage, we use Qdrant vector database, which enables semantic search and intelligent retrieval. We maintain several collections: incidents stored with embeddings for similarity search, contract clauses for reference, usage templates for pattern recognition, and a resolution knowledge base that learns from past incidents. The vector nature of the database allows us to find similar past incidents, retain organizational knowledge, and scale storage efficiently while enabling powerful search capabilities."

---

## Slide 9: Dashboard Features
**Script:**
"The user experience is centered around our interactive Streamlit dashboard. We have four main pages: the Dashboard shows key financial metrics and trends, the Incidents page provides filterable incident management, the Detection page allows users to run detection jobs, and the Data Generator helps create test data. For visualizations, we provide financial impact charts to show leakage over time, incident distribution graphs, root cause analysis breakdowns, and trend monitoring to track improvements."

---

## Slide 10: Data Generator & Processing
**Script:**
"To make testing and development easier, we've built comprehensive data handling capabilities. Our data generator can create realistic sample files in PDF, CSV, and JSON formats - mimicking actual billing statements, provisioning records, and contract data. For file processing, we support PDF OCR capabilities for scanned documents, CSV parsing for structured data, and JSON processing for configuration files. Users can also upload their own data files. This flexibility makes it easy to test the system and integrate with various data sources."

---

## Slide 11: Deployment Options
**Script:**
"We've designed the system for flexible deployment. You can deploy on Streamlit Cloud for the easiest setup, use Docker for containerized deployment in your environment, or install manually on traditional servers. The minimum requirements are a Qdrant database instance - either cloud-hosted or self-hosted - and a Gemini API key. The architecture supports horizontal scaling, making it suitable for both small organizations and large enterprises with high data volumes."

---

## Slide 12: Key Benefits
**Script:**
"The business value of our solution is substantial. Financially, it reduces revenue leakage, accelerates incident resolution, automates investigation processes, and enables proactive leak prevention. Operationally, it provides 24/7 monitoring, reduces manual work, ensures consistent processes, and improves resource allocation. From a technical standpoint, we offer real-time processing capabilities, a scalable architecture, intelligent analysis features, and an extensible design that can grow with your organization's needs."

---

## Slide 13: Implementation Status
**Script:**
"I'm pleased to report that the core system is fully implemented and ready for deployment. We've completed the detection engine, integrated CrewAI agents, set up Qdrant database, built the Streamlit dashboard, implemented the data generator, and configured deployment options. The system is ready for testing with real data, integration with your data sources, and production deployment. All the core functionality you've seen in this presentation is working and available."

---

## Slide 14: Future Enhancements
**Script:**
"Looking ahead, we have an exciting roadmap. Planned features include machine learning model integration for even more sophisticated detection, advanced pattern recognition capabilities, predictive leakage prevention to stop issues before they occur, and multi-language support for international deployments. On the technical side, we're planning enhanced NLP capabilities, improved dashboard user experience, advanced reporting features, and API expansion for better integration with third-party systems."

---

## Slide 15: Demo
**Script:**
"Now I'd like to show you a live demonstration of the system in action. We'll walk through the dashboard navigation, see the data generation capabilities, observe the incident detection workflow, watch the AI agent investigation process, and explore the financial impact visualizations. This will give you a hands-on feel for how the system works in practice."
